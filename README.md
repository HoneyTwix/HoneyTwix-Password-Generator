Password Generator Starter Code

Purpose:

This project is a refractor of a pre-existing code which was used to make a website called password generator. Allows the user to create a password when needed

Goal:

The code is refactored because it was missing the ability to allow the user to create a password. In the javascript there was code to write a password but there needed to be code to create that password based on the criteria of the user and what they wanted. Password security is very important for people's security so creating a random password generator will make people's lives a little more safe.
